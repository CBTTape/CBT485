FWIW,

File 485 comes with no instructions. So here are some:

Add a member to your VTAMLST called X:

X VBUILD TYPE=APPL
Z APPL AUTH=VPACE,EAS=1,PARSESS=NO,SESSLIM=YES,ACBNAME=Y

Make the VTAM control blocks active
V NET,ACT,ID=X

DOC 2:

Assembly instructions. You may need the SYSLIB for input to point
at SYS1.MODGEN and SYS1.MACLIB depending on where your VTAM
macros are.  There are no special link edit (bind) parameters. If
you want to use TSO TEST, then make sure you code parameter TEST
in the parm of both the ASM and Linkedit.

DOC 3:
Build a USER.PROCLIB member. Here's mine:
//TESTVTM2 PROC
//STEP1 EXEC PGM=TESTVTM2,TIME=1440,REGION=0M,PARM='Y       '
//STEPLIB DD DISP=SHR,DSN=MY.SYSLMOD.LIB

At the console enter S TESTVTM2

If you get an abend code, the abendcode matches a CHKERR spot in
the code.  Set a breakpoint in the TSO TEST (from Ready prompt)
at the offending macro.  Usually you will get an abend U006
because the ACBNAME is the main issue. If you get a message that
says  @TESTVTM2 - Application Y is up, go to a 3270 session and
enter l y. This will send a message to the console TERMINAL
xxxxxx  SIGNON ACCEPTED, and you'll get a message at the terminal
like Welcome to the TESTVTM2 application Y. If you clear the
screen you'll get a message YOU CANT CLEAR THIS SCREEN. If you
type LOGOFF at the 3270, the application will log you off and a
console message will be sent. You can then CANCEL TESTVTM2.
