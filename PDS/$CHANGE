2000/11/01 - Original version for ACF/VTAM systems    Binyamin Dissen
             published on CBT file 485

2003/02/11 - Minimal port to non ACF VTAM level 2     Greg Price
             published on www.prycroft6.com.au

2012/06/29 - Completion of VTAM level 2 port          Juergen Winkelmann
             and additional terminal support:
             o remove CLSDST calls from timer loop
               (this obviously isn't supported by
               VTAM level 2) and create a seperate
               loop in mainline to handle these.
             o fix LOGON exit plist incompatibility.
             o reintroduce INQUIRE at logon to
               distinguish terminal types.
             o issue WSF QUERY to 3270 terminals.
             o change message handling to support
               3270 and tty datastreams.
             o special appearance of Volker's cat
               on all 3270 screens.
